One of the metal rings remains static, while the other keeps rotating to facilitate sealing through friction between the two components. The arrangement is made to have frictional faces constantly lubricated by utilising system lubricants, essentially Oil or Grease, depending upon the situation."

          "A Rotovator is also called as Rotary tiller, which consists of a steel frame, a rotary shaft on which blades are mounted, power transmission system and gearbox. The blades are of Ltype, made from medium carbon steel or alloy steel, hardened and tempered to suitable hardness. The PTO of tractor drives the rotovator. Rotary motion of the PTO is transmitted to the shaft carrying the blades through gearbox and transmission system. A good seedbed and pulverization of the soil is achieved in a single pass of the rotovator.<br/><br/>Rotavator is the most efficient system when we ask for a definitive tillage solution. Irrespective of the soil type, the conditions or amount of residues: The result is always the best. It can be adjusted to get many different working depths and soil finish with very easy changes. The Rotovator is also the most versatile implement for two purposes.<br/>1. Crumbling: It can be set from a very coarse tillage to a very fine finish<br/>2. Residues mixing: It can cope with high amounts of weeds or trash without blocking and giving the most perfect mixture of the residues. The benefits are a complete clean surface and easy incorporation of organic material to the soil."
