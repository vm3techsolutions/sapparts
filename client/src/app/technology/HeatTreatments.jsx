          At SAP Parts, we have special ways to make our metal parts strong and
          durable. We use a set of advanced treatments and high-tech furnaces to
          change the metal's structure so it's perfect for the job it needs to
          do.
        </p>
        <p className="Paragraph text-center sm:px-16">
          We have our own in-house furnaces, including custom ones and
          high-quality IPSen furnaces. This gives us full control over the
          process, allowing us to precisely manage temperature and timing to get
          the exact properties we need.
